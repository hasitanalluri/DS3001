    "- A matrix class objected is created by passing in\n",
    " a list of lists, and the class functions are then things like matrix multiplication or RREF\n",
    "- An $ N \\times K $ object is a matrix, an $ N \\times 1$ object is a vector, and a $ 1 \\times 1 $ object is a scalar: These are all generally called **tensors**, and the **rank** of a tensor is how many dimensions it has (scalar is 0 rank, vector is 1 rank, matrix is 2 rank). I'm going to call everything an $N \\times K$ matrix.\n",
    "- The goal is to introduce you to thinking about classes, error handling, and importing packages a bit more thoughtfully\n",
    "- If you haven't watched the linear algebra video, go do that so you can understand what is happening\n",
    "- You should use NumPy, not what we do today. But what we do today will help you understand NumPy much better."

    "- The `__init__(self,...)` function describes how an instance is initialized or constructed. Every class has this function.\n",
    "- The class methods refer to `self` and the class functions do not. \n",
    "    - When you include `self` as an argument, you can use `A.fcn()` to apply the function to object `A`. \n",
    "    - If you do not include `self`, you instead use `class.fcn(A,B)` to apply the function to class instances `A` and `B`. \n",
    "    - So, for example, `A.t()` takes the transpose of `A`, while `Mx.add(A,B)` adds `A` and `B` together.\n",
    "- The Operator Overloading sections shows you how to make your class \"fit in\" to the Python computing environment. You can bind methods to the `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` operators, among others, to tell Python how to do computations with your new class.\n",
    "    - The `*` case is interesting: I want `*` to handle scalar and matrix multiplication correctly. All of the cases are trying to make that work, and I did not quite succeed.\n",
    "- The `__repr__(self)` function describes what happens when users simply type the name of a class instance into the interpreter. Here, I chose to print the matrix. Sometimes, users don't understand that the object itself is not just the repr output. It really helps to understand this.\n",
    "- The `__print__(self)` function describes what happens when you type `print(A)`: This is different from `repr`, and explains why the output looks different in notebooks or the interpreter depending on what you're doing."

More generally, you can given instructions to the Python interpreter about the package should be imported. For example, if you add `__all__ = [\"something1\", \"something2\"]` to `__init__.py`, then `from packageName import *` only imports the something's that are listed. \n",
